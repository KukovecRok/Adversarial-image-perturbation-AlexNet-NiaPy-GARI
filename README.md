# Making AlexNet CNN inefficient using NiaPy's evolutionary algorithms
Predicting images from  ILSVRC dataset using AlexNet. Then recreating the correctly classified image(s) using NiaPy's evolutionary algorithms, trying to recreate it as similiar to original as possible, to the point, that AlexNet fails its prediction.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Pip
* NiaPy 2.0.0rc12

### Warning
Code is in early stage, some paths etc. are still hardcoded. Images used are on my GoogleDrive, therefore there is a problem with accessing them. 

### Current plan
Battling with a bug, that does not display image from array, if array has been modified whatsoever.
